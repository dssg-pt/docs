# Code of Conduct

Our Code of Conduct applies to all Volunteers and Beneficiaries' repesentatives in all of our Projects, all of our Beneficiaries, all of our public events and all of our official communication channels/platforms. We hope that these things go without saying. We want to ensure that everyone who comes into DSSG's Portugal space to feel welcome, and we want to foster a safe, productive environment for every member of our Community.

Our Anti-Harassment Policy (below) explicitly outlines the behavior for which we have a zero tolerance policy. If you feel that you or anyone else is being harassed or treated unfairly, or have any other concerns about this policy, please contact one of our reference Points of Contact: 

+ Hugo Esteves via private Slack message or by email at hugo@dssg.pt. 
+ Ana Ferreira via private Slack message or by email at ana@dssg.pt. 

# Anti-Harassment Policy

Data Science for Social Good is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for every individual regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, age, race, religion; the use or display of sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation and stalking; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately and may be sanctioned or expelled from the Community/event at the discretion of the DSSG PT's _Lead Team_. The _Lead Team_ may take any lawful action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to warning the offender or asking the offender to leave the Project/event/community. 

If you feel anyone has violated this policy, please bring it up directly with the individual or with DSSG's reference Points of Contact regarding these issues (mentioned above). If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should contact DSSG PT's _Lead Team_ (through the same Points of Contact) with a concise description of your grievance; all grievances will be considered.
