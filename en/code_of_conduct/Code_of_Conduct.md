# Code of Conduct

Our Code of Conduct applies to all participants in all of our events open to external partners and the public, as well as to the fellowship itself. We hope that these things go without saying. We want to ensure that everyone who comes into the DSSG space to feel welcome, and we want to foster a safe, productive environment for fellows, staff, and visitors.

Our Anti-Harassment Policy (below) explicitly outlines the behavior for which we have a zero tolerance policy. If you feel that you or anyone else is being harassed or treated unfairly, or have any other concerns about this policy, please contact one of your fellow advocates: Jane Zanzig via private Slack message or by call/text at (206) 235-6912 Rob Mitchum via private Slack message or by call/text at (773) 484-9890

# Anti-Harassment Policy

Data Science for Social Good is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience in all event venues, including talks, parties, and online media, for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, age, race, religion, the use or display of sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately and may be sanctioned or expelled from the fellowship or fellowship events at the discretion of the organizers. Organizers may take any lawful action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to warning the offender or asking the offender to leave the fellowship or event.

If you feel anyone has violated this policy, please bring it up directly with the individual or with a DSSG staff member or fellow advocate.

If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this code of conduct, you should contact the fellowship staff team with a concise description of your grievance; all grievances will be considered.
